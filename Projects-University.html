        <h6>UNIVERSITY PROJECTS</h6>
          
          University is a great time to learn all kinds of stuff. We get so caught up in our studies that we forget that there is so much more offered by University life. During my summer term at Waterloo, I was actively involved in a fuel cell car competition. We were divided in groups and asked design a complete mini-car that runs on a 2V hydrogen fuel cell, which could compete in an obstacle race by the end of the term. 
            In my group, I was the head of the mechanical and electrical design team. This meant long hours, designing and playing around with different ideas to optimize the performance of our fuel cell car. We came up with a myriad ways to set up the chassis with the fuel cell system sitting on top of it. We also designed the control system using remote control(R.C).

            As you may have read in the "About Me" section, I have a great passion for sports. I make sure I am playing intramural soccer/basketball almost every term. My team, which consisted of roomates from University residence, did very well in the tournament and in fact made it to the semi-finals in two consecutive terms.
