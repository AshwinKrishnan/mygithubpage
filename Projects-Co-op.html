          <dd>MATCOR-MATSU GROUPS : <br>
            I was fortunate to have my first work term at Matcor-Matsu in Mississauga, Canada. Matcor-Matsu is a growing automotive-parts supplier to different OEM customers. The automotive division supplies simple and complex assembly units while the fabrication group provides manufacturing solutions to different customers. <br><br>
            I spent my first term as the System/Network administrator at the Mississauga plant. This instilled many technical as well as customer-relation skills in me. I was responsible for pretty much the entire IT infrastructure of the plant and worked on improving the IT department of the company.
            This required me to know my technical skills and have troubleshooting strategies to help the employees with a variety of problems ranging from complex server issues to basic hardware/software issues. To read a more detailed account of my daily duties at the company please consult my resume.
