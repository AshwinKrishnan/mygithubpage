          <dd>Software has become such an important part of our lives. Even as an Electrical Engineering student that is more oriented towards hardware, I understand the importance of software development in the current timeline.<br> <br>

           My love for programming is growing day by day. As a junior developer, I get the privilege of working with different languages to help me design cool games and small applications. At school, I am currently learning the basics of object-oriented programming in C#. I have also picked up Java, which is a very similar language that is used almost everywhere, from cell-phones to server/client side applications to webpages.<br><br>
             
          I am also working on my very own webpage as you can see. I pretty much learnt HTML, CSS and JavaScript(jQuery) by myself and put together a personal E-portfolio to share my projects and experiences to the world. For a more detailed understanding of the specific projects that I have done please have a look at my resume.
